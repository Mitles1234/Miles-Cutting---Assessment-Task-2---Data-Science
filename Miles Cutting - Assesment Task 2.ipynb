    "**Cyber Security:**  Once an application is on the web, there are several levels of secuity that then need to have. The level of security will vary between application based on how much data it collects, what kind of data it collects, and the value the data it collects. Three of these levels are user authentication, password hashing, and encryption. User authentication is the process of validating a user is who they say they are. An example of this is a username and password system. Password hashing is having a program change a password into an encrypted state while a program uses it. This process makes it harder for hackers to obtain passwords. The final layer of security is encryption. Encryption converts data into a form that is unusable without a key. This limits who has access to the data to only authorised people who have been given the key. This improves the security of a system."

    "Calculations: In my program, their where various calculations. The first calculation in my program is creating the rolling total column in my building csv files. To accomplish this, first many rows where removed until only the neccessary data was there, then the entire table was reverse sorted to make the years count up. Now the calculations where prefored, using the cumulative sum function (.cumsum()), I was able to create a rolling total, first the value from the 'Total' column was collected, and then added to the cumulative sum, this process repeated down the csv file to create a rolling total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other calulation in my program is with the API. The value for the wind speed is given in m/s, however, Knots is a unit that is more valuable for the target demographic of my software. Because of this, I multiply the wind speed by 1.944.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: The data displayed in the graphs is accuract, this is evident as any calaculations preformed have been checked manually, and been checked with other sources, i.e checking m/s to knots with multiple sources such as google calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions: Due to the limited access to historical weather data, my original goal for the project of seeing how buildings affect wind speed isn't very clear. I think that if this was to be done again, I would need better locations (Gosford is extremely Good at showing this but I couldnt find any csv files for there), and I would need a larger catalouge of historical data to show. However, this analysis has also shown many unexpected results, such as the average wind speed being only 50% of the peak which is information that interesting and important to learn. It may affect how someone such as a sailor sets up i.e if the wind speed is 20km/h, but it is likely to gust to 40km/h against if it just stays at 20km/h.\n",
