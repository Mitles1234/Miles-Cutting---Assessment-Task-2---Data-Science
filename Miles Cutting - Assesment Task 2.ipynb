    "\n",
    "**Data Privacy of the Source:** For the data to remain a reliable source, their needs to be control over who can access it and change it. The way the data I am using is set up, no one but the original creator of the data can change the original data, only create editable copies. This leaves the responsability of the data to a smaller pool reducing the risk of becoming unreliable. It also makes someone accountable if the data does become unreliable.\n",

    "**Application Data Privacy:** My application doesn't and won't collect user data. This means there is no user data to protect and that their are no responsibilities to maintain the application in the area of user privacy and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cyber Security:**  Once an application is on the web, there are several levels of secuity that then need to have. The level of security will vary between application based on how much data it collects, what kind of data it collects, and the value the data it collects. Three of these levels are user authentication, password hashing, and encryption. User authentication is the process of validating a user is who they say they are. An example of this is a username and password system. Password hashing is having a program change a password into an encrypted state while a program uses it. This process makes it harder for hackers to obtain passwords. The final layer of security is encryption. Encryption converts data into a form that is unusable without a key. This limits who has access to the data to only authorised people who have been given the key. This improves the security of a system."

    "Calculations: In my program, their where various calculations. The first calculation in my program is creating the rolling total column in my building csv files. To accomplish this, first many rows where removed until only the neccessary data was there, then the entire table was reverse sorted to make the years count up. Now the calculations where prefored, using the cumulative sum function (.cumsum()), I was able to create a rolling total, first the value from the 'Total' column was collected, and then added to the cumulative sum, this process repeated down the csv file to create a rolling total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other calulation in my program is with the API. The value for the wind speed is given in m/s, however, Knots is a unit that is more valuable for the target demographic of my software. Because of this, I multiply the wind speed by 1.944.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: The data displayed in the graphs is accuract, this is evident as any calaculations preformed have been checked manually, and been checked with other sources, i.e checking m/s to knots with multiple sources such as google calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions: Due to the limited access to historical weather data, my original goal for the project of seeing how buildings affect wind speed isn't very clear. I think that if this was to be done again, I would need better locations (Gosford is extremely Good at showing this but I couldnt find any csv files for there), and I would need a larger catalouge of historical data to show. However, this analysis has also shown many unexpected results, such as the average wind speed being only 50% of the peak which is information that interesting and important to learn. It may affect how someone such as a sailor sets up i.e if the wind speed is 20km/h, but it is likely to gust to 40km/h against if it just stays at 20km/h.\n",

    "Overall I agree with what my peers said about my program. I think my program does meet upto my functional and non function requirements however I agree with Rufus when he says I need more ways to show my data. I think adding a new tab like I have for the settings and for the Weather API could be used to impliment this if I where to in the future. \n",

    "My final product was able to meet all of my sucess criteria. I was successfully able to show the average windspeed and gust speed of my chosen location. By using my weather data set csv file, I was able to extract both the wind speed of a location, and the gust speed of the loaction. This means I was successful in my first criteria. My second functional requirement was to show the trend of how many new buildings are being built in a given location. I was also able to complete this functional requirement extemely well. My final functional requirement was to be able to present both pieces of this information together on one graph. I was successful at this by using dual axis's when plotting my graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "My non-functional requirements where to create an easy to use and understand UI, and a clear and easy to follow README file. With the use of a GUI, I was able to sucessfully complete my first criteria. It is a simple interface with options to change what appears in the graph. This makes it fit the crirtia well. My README file is also effective at explaining nuances or inconsitances in the GUI. The README is also simple to reed with headings that clearly explain what is being discussed.\n",

    "Evaluation: Project Management\n",
    "Overall, the project tested all areas of my ability to handle a taks ranging from time management to problem solving. One of the largest challenges in the project was my time management. Their are some areas in which I spent to little time on and others where I spent to much. Overall, this left me leaving things until the final moment of the task. The problem solving of my GUI was where I spent most of my time. Lots of my code worked in its own isolated bubble, however, while trying to connect it all, many issues arose. One of these is how tkinter and python handle variables. To make my python based outputs work with my tkinter inputs, I had to convert lots of variables before preforming functions. This is most notable in the Graph() function. Another area which caused issues was implimenting the api. Because of how the API worked, I had to have functions inside of funtions. Although, this taught me that if you define a variable in a function, it is not global to all the other sub-functions. This whas the error that allowed my code to work in its own file but not in my final file and took many hours to fix. I gave this task everything I could to produce a result that I was extremely happy with. I learnt lots about how to make a GUI and how to impliment different pieces of code together to make my own."
